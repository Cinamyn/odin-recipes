# odin-recipes
This will my first project within The Odin Project.
My objectives are to fully complete this project.
The code should look clean with indentation and no bloat.
I am hoping to showcase all the skills I have learned up to this point, within this course.

REVIEW: Now that the project is done. I feel very satisfied with my work. I took my time and made sure it looked good. The code looks clean to me. Ready to move on!
